# Boulder ANS Graphing

This project was designed to help the Boulder Reservoir Track the potential invasive species that are entering and leaving the park. This graph shows the quantity reported to the ANS database. When running with Dash, the webpage includes hyperlinked datapoints, 
referenced as "blocks" in the description. Each block redirects to the corresponding ANS entry.  



This is for private use only, for the use of the Boulder Reservoir. I am using this as a project portfolio item.
